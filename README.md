# Variated-Titan-Flame-Particle-Generator
This C++ script generates customized versions of the Titan Flame particle trail from the Minecraft Java Edition server Mineplex

It takes the radius of it's circle, the number of frames represented by the number of `points` and the amount of points of the trail represented by the number of `intersections`. A system composed of minecraft commands is generated that displays a nice variation of the Titan Flame Particle Trail, as shown in the videos bellow.

Insipred by geenium's circle point coordinates generator https://github.com/geenium/circle-coords/blob/master/circle_coords.js as well as from the beloved Mineraft server Mineplex :)
